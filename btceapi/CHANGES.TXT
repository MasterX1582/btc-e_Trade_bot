Changes in 0.2:
  - There have been several API changes (detailed below), but hopefully this
    version will not break your code too much.  I've tried to stick to issuing
    warnings where breakage may occur in later versions.
  - Switched to decimal.Decimal for currency handling to avoid rounding issues.
    This is the one change that is most likely to break your code.
  - The TradeAPI now takes an optional handler, which should be a KeyHandler
    instance (or equivalent).  This allows the TradeAPI object to automatically
    update the nonce held by the KeyHandler. In future versions, this argument 
    will be required, and the secret argument will be removed, as the handler
    can provide this information.
  - The KeyHandler constructor now takes an optional resaveOnDeletion argument,
    and this class will automatically rewrite nonces back into the key file on
    deletion if this flag is true.
  - The all_currencies, all_pairs, max_digits, and min_orders variables in 
    common are now available at the top level of the library.
  - Switched all classes to be new-style (I wanted to make the KeyHandler keys
    member a property for backwards compatibility, and the property decorator
    works best with new-style classes, so this is mainly for consistency).
  - Added a new sample showing suggested 0.2 usage.  The old sample remains
    for now.
  - Changed common.formatCurrency to take a pair instead of maxdigits so you
    no longer have to do that lookup yourself.
  - Added more tests.
